<h1>Basic Info and Schooling</h1>
I am 18 years old and am from Montclair, NJ. 
Montclair was my home throughout my primary school career - I attended Montclair Public schools from K-8th grade.
My high school career was split between two locations: Seton Hall Prep and Bergen Catholic.
I spent my first two years at SHP and my final two years at BC.
I narrowed down my college choices slowly, but eventually, I settled on TCNJ - less than a week before my deposit was due!
I am currently in my second semester at TCNJ in the spring of 2020.  
I am undeclared and not leaning in any particular direction quite yet.
I also play on TCNJ's varsity basketball team.
My first semester was fun and successful - I am anticipating many more of the like.
