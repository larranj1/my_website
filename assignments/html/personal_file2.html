<h1> My Hobbies </h1>
Many of my hobbies are fueled by my creativity. I have always been creative 
and inquisitive. I quell my need for a creative outlet through a number 
of different hobbies.  I've done arts and crafts: I've made hundreds of 
duct tape wallets, folded countless paper airplanes, and constructed impressive 
structures out of cardboard, Kapla blocks, and legos.  So far, I am enjoying 
building my website, too. However, two hobbies of mine are closer to my heart 
than any other hobby.

First is music. I've always been extremely passionate for music: listening, analyzing,
performing, and above all, creating.  I've played the drums since
I was old enough to smack pots and pans with wooden spoons, attempting 
to emulate Phil Collins as I watched him perform on DVD.
I eventually was gifted my first drum kit and drums in particular have been
a massive part of my life ever since.  I also play guitar; I began learning 
when I was in 4th grade and picked it up very quickly.  I never took guitar 
quite as serious as drums, so I'm not nearly as good at guitar as I am drums.  
By 7th grade, I began making music on my computer.  First, I made electronic 
music, then hip-hop, and now all sorts.  Recently, I've been making more 
rock music than anything, tracking live guitar and drums and using MIDI to 
write bass, piano, and any other parts.  Music production has led me to 
fall in love with the technical side of music and begin exploring genres of
music many people don't know exist.

The hobby closest to my heart is basketball.  I've played all my life, been
raised in a family with basketball history.  Most of my Dad's side
of the family played college basketball, and a few played professional.  My Uncle,
who played college ball at Providence in the 70s, is the Head coach of the University
of Miami men's basketball team.  He has over 650 career wins, and in 2006, he led mid-major George
Mason University to the Division 1 NCAA Tournament Final Four.  My cousin is 
the current lead assistant coach for the Boston Celtics.  I've experienced
a significant amount of adversity through the sport.  In high school, I played
on one of the top 50 teams in the country.  My senior year, 
we had nine players with division 1 scholarships.  I loved being part of such 
a great team and it helped me on and off the court unbelievably.  However,
on the court, my talents were often outshined. As a result, there have been 
times - as recent as last year - when I hated basketball and was ready to 
divert my attention from it.  Now I realize quitting would have been a
massive error and I am so glad I didn't because I love it now more than ever. 
Basketball has been, currently is, and will continue to be a huge part of my 
life and a hobby I will never grow sick of.
