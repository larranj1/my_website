  <p>Too difficult to navigate and find what you're looking for.  "Artsy" view is prioritized before functionality.  However, this website's layout does make some 
  sense given the nature of their business -- limited and trendy fashion.  I dislike the main font used.  I have no issues with its color scheme.</p>

  <p>This website is very bland.  It functions as it's supposed to, but it is not appealing in any way related to design: color is boring and generic, the font selection
  (which is unvaried and too small in places) is not visually appealing, there is no method of organization beyond the alphabitized game selection menu. </p>
  <li> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> </li>
   <p> Reddit is too cluttered for my liking.  I don't have much against it's color scheme or font selection.  I think the color is a little boring; however, it's probably
   that way so as to not distract the user from the important information of the website.  The font is easy to read and sized well.  Although these two attributes
   aren't distracting (and may even be helpful to the website's purpose), the clutter distracts enough to negate the positives font and color provide. </p>
